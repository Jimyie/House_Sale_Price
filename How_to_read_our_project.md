There are 3 folders in our submission.

-"report" folder contains "BAIT509_Project_Jinye_Xiaomeng_Egor.pdf", which is our main report and the delivery.
-"code" folder contains our code in R or Python. They are named by order and the topic correspond to our report.

Note that we output csv "train_cleaned.csv" for further analysis after we've finish data cleaning.

-"original" folder contains the original dataset "train.csv" and a texted description to help you understand our dataset.

If you have any question about our project, please contact: Xiaomeng Wei, riowxm@my.yorku.ca
Thank you.
